<ul>
1¾ cups all-purpose flour

1½ teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon salt

¼ cup butter, melted

1 egg, lightly beaten

1 cup milk

1 cup shredded unpeeled zucchini

1 clove garlic, minced

¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

4 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled
</ul>

    Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.

Step 2
Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.

Step 3
In another bowl, stir together the butter, egg, milk, zucchini, and garlic until well blended. Mix the flour mixture into the milk mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between additions, until the flour mixture is incorporated. Fold in the Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and crumbled bacon, and pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups.

Step 4
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow muffins to cool slightly before removing from muffin cups; serve warm. Refrigerate leftovers.
