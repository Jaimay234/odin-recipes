    Description
</h1>
<ul>
    5 fresh jalapeno peppers

4 pounds ground beef

salt and pepper to taste

1 egg

¼ cup steak sauce, (e.g. Heinz 57)

¼ cup minced white onion

1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)

1 pinch dried oregano

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

1 teaspoon garlic salt

¼ cup crushed Fritos® corn chips

8 large potato hamburger buns

8 slices pepperjack cheese
</ul>
<h2>
    Step 1
Preheat a grill for high heat. When the grill is hot, roast the jalapeno peppers until blackened on all sides. Place in a plastic bag to sweat and loosen the blackened skin. Rub the skin off, then seed if desired, and chop.

Step 2
In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and Fritos®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.

Step 3
Grill patties for 10 to 15 minutes, turning once, or until well done. I always drink one beer, then flip, drink another beer, then remove from the grill and place on buns. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and pig out!
